1] BSD500 photo is the dataset for plain photographs.
2] sentinal-1
3] TerraSar-X
4] AIRSAR
5] ALOS-PALSAR
6] ERS-2
8] UC merced land Use dataset - the data is similar to SAR data.
9] NWPU dataset - the data is similar to SAR data.  
therefore including 7, 8, 9 in the training set will help
to learn priors that can better match the characteristics of SAR
data and will result in a reduced domain gap. reference: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05508.pdf
